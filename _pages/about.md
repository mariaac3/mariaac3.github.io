After obtaining a bachelor's degree in Physics at [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), **I am working on my PhD in Physics at [Duke University]() as part of the [Cosmology Group](https://physics.duke.edu/research/astrophysics).**

My research focuses on understanding the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and the nature of dark energy.
In particular, I work with low-redshift Type Ia supernovae, developing and refining nearby samples used for cosmology. By improving the quality and calibration of the local supernova dataset, my work strengthens distance measurements and anchors the cosmic distance ladder.

I am involved in [Roman Supernova Project Infastructure Team](https://www.romansnpit.com/) and with the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Survey ([DEBASS](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/debass/)).
