After obtaining a bachelor's degree in Physics at [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), **I am working on my PhD in Physics at [Duke University]() as part of the [Cosmology Group](https://physics.duke.edu/research/astrophysics).**

My research focuses on understanding the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and the nature of dark energy.
In particular, I use type Ia supernovae in the nearby universe to measure distances and infer the peculiar velocity field. This field is linked to the growth of structures and allows to test the standard model of cosmology and general relativity.

I am involved in [Roman Supernova Infastructure Team](https://www.romansnpit.com/) and with the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Survey ([DEBASS](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/debass/)).
